# flexboxdemomod
modification of Carl's Flexbox Demo
<br>
just having a little fun experimenting with a few little code tweaks here and there
<br>
see if you can make some fun modifications: make the boxes smaller, add a different image, change the max number of boxes shown, change the default number of boxes, change the font, change the size/color of the font, etc... 
<br>
have fun!
